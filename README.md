# ARCC
ARCC - Allowable Revocable Contract Chain System for Bitcoin Cash

> Note: This is the implementation of ARCC system.

Transactions in Bitcoin Cash are irreversible i.e permanent, which means that once the money leaves the userâ€™s wallet and gets included in a block, it cannot be taken back. Bitcoin Cash aims to be the money for the world. But in the real world, many cases require one party to be able to control the flow of funds and still give restricted access to another party to spend that money.
ARCC, a Bitcoin Cash Smart Contract Chain System allows the payer to take back the money while still allowing the payee to withdraw some funds from the contract based on restrictions of time and amount.
There can be a range of applications/mechanisms possible including but not limited to, Streaming Services, Pay as you use, Recurring payments, Milestone based payouts, Project funding, Pocket money etc.
